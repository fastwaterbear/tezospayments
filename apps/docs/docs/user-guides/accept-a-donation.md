# Accept a donation
To start accepting donations, you first need an account in the Tezos network. If you don’t have one, please create it using one of the most popular wallets, e.g., [Temple](https://templewallet.com), [Kukai](https://wallet.kukai.app).  
If you have it, you’re ready to move on.

:::info

You need some amount of Tezos to pay network fees while communicating with your services, through which payments will be made.

:::

## Step 1: Connect a Tezos account to the Dashboard application
1. Open the dashboard app by the following URL:  
[https://dashboard.tezospayments.com](https://dashboard.tezospayments.com)
2. Click **Connect**.
3. Choose the wallet that you are using.
4. In your wallet, click **Connect** / **Approve** / **Confirm**.

Once you approve the connection, you'll be connected to the Tezos Payments Dashboard application and ready to use that.

## Step 2: Create a service
Service is a component that accepts funds from your contributors and sends them to you. Also, the service shows your contributors public information about you.

1. Click **Create Service** or open the Create Service page by this URL:  
[https://dashboard.tezospayments.com/services/create](https://dashboard.tezospayments.com/services/create)
2. Fill in public information that your customers will be seen when paying:

    * **Service Name** - it can be your real name, nickname, or any identifier helping the payers make sure they’re doing the right donates.  
    The field is required.
    * **Description** - a short description of you.  
    The field is optional.
    * **Links** - links to your site, social media, or other links.  
    This field is optional.

    :::caution

    Public information about your service will be stored on the Tezos blockchain, so it'll be available to everyone at all times. You   won't be able to delete this information.
    Please be careful when you fill in this information.

    :::

3. Verify the filled information for correctness.
4. Click **Create Service**.
5. Your wallet will prompt you to confirm the operation, which is an interaction with the Tezos Payments Factory Contract.
    
    :::info

    Creating a service is a blockchain operation that why it requires some Tezos tokens to be completed.

7. Once the service has been created, you can go to the next step.
